    <h2>Brief Text Editor Emulation for Visual Studio Code</h2>

    <p>This plug-in adds key bindings and functionality that attempts to emulate many features of the original BRIEF MS-DOS application. BRIEF (Basic Re-configurable Interactive Editing Facility) was a popular programmer's text editor in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Developed by UnderWare Inc, it was quite powerful and feature rich for its time. See the Wikipedia page &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brief_(text_editor)" target="_blank">Brief (text editor)</a>&quot;.</p>
    <p>I started using Brief in the early 1990s when I was at Compaq Computer Corporation working on printers. I thought then that it was way beyond anything I had used to date.</p>
    <p>I created this project as an exercise for me to learn Visual Studio Code plug-in development; Just having fun. I don't think that there is a high demand for Brief emulation in the Visual Studio Code IDE. Don't get me wrong, there was a lot of effort that went into this plug-in. I have always really liked the Brief key assignments and feature set and I try and set it up in any editor I use. So if you are/were also into Brief, I hope you enjoy using this.</p>
    <p>One of the goals of this project was to have minimal effect on the underlying Visual Studio Code &quot;StyledText&quot; editor. So this is by no means a perfect example of the Brief editor  and it's a little quirky at times, mainly because it is limited by the API and architecture of the existing editor. I try to note any deviations in the command descriptions, at least, deviations from the limited documentation and knowledge I have. I have also added some commands as documented below. You can, of course, disable any key bindings and/or set them back to default in  the &quot;preferences-&gt;general-&gt;keys&quot; menu.</p>
    <p>BTW, I don't have a working example of Brief, just the old documentation. Feel free to let me know if I have implemented something improperly. Also, I did not try to emulate all of Brief's functionality. This is most certainly a subset.</p>
    <p>I highly recommend installing Andrey Loskutov's AnyEditTools. It's really handy.</p>

    <h3>Installation</h3>

    <p>When you install, it will present you with a self signed certificate. Sorry about that. I am a retired software developer, so I cannot afford to spend money on a code signing certificate for hobby work.<p>Anyway, after you install the plug-in you will probably have to restart the IDE. Then you will need to go into Window->Preferences->General->Keys and select "Brief Text Editor Emulation" as the scheme.</p>

    <h3>Commands</h3>

    <p>
        The following are the key bindings and commands implemented by the plugin. Brief functionality that is currently the default behavior, or close enough, is not re-implemented by the plug-in and not documented here. Outside of the active marking modes, mouse functionality is not intentionally modified.<br /><br />
        If you are looking for the full Brief command set, try the following link. &quot;<a href="http://christopoulos.users.sourceforge.net/cbrief/brief.php" target="_blank">About BRIEF Text Editor</a>&quot;. Otherwise, search for it with your favorite search engine.
    </p>

    <p>
        NOTE! The plug-in does not currently support line/code folding, at least not very well. So best to unfold the area of the file you are working on if you want the commands to work as expected.

    <p id="footnotes"  style="margin-left: 2%">
        <sup id="fn1">1) Uses Project Explorer &quot;rename&quot; dialog for the currently active editor. This commits the change to file storage. <a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1.">&#x2196;</a></sup><br />
        <sup id="fn2">2) Pressing &lt;Home&gt; will move the cursor/caret to the beginning of the current line if it is not already there. If the cursor/caret is already at the beginning of the line, pressing &lt;Home&gt; will move the cursor/caret to the beginning of the window. If the cursor/caret is already at the beginning of the window, pressing &lt;Home&gt; will move the cursor/caret to the beginning of the buffer/file. <a href="#ref2" title="Jump back to footnote 2.">&#x2196;</a></sup><br />
        <sup id="fn3">3) Pressing &lt;End&gt; will move the cursor/caret to the end of the current line if it is not already there. If the cursor/caret is already at the end of the line, pressing &lt;End&gt; will move the cursor/caret to the end of the window. If the cursor/caret is already at the end of the window, pressing &lt;End&gt; will move the cursor/caret to the end of the buffer/file. <a href="#ref3" title="Jump back to footnote 3.">&#x2196;</a></sup><br />
        <sup id="fn4">4) New command. This mode facilitates column selection or pasting that is beyond the end of a line (virtual character space). Place the cursor beyond the end of an existing line by positioning the mouse at the desired location and depressing &lt;Alt + V&gt;. You can reposition with mouse clicks. Switch to column mode with &lt;Alt + C&gt; and move cursor to change selection. Can also paste into the virtual space.  Any keystroke before entering column mode will exit from virtual caret mode.<a href="#ref4" title="Jump back to footnote 4.">&#x2196;</a></sup><br />
        <sup id="fn5">5) Bookmark 10 is dropped using the 0 key. <a href="#ref5" title="Jump back to footnote 5.">&#x2196;</a></sup><br />
        <sup id="fn6">6) According to the documentation, pressing the &lt;Tab&gt; key in the Jump Bookmark dialog will bring up a menu of bookmarks. This is difficult to do in normal dialogs since &lt;Tab&gt; moves focus. So &lt;Alt + B&gt; will bring up the bookmarks dialog/menu. <a href="#ref6" title="Jump back to footnote 6.">&#x2196;</a></sup><br />
        <sup id="fn7">7) AKA the clipboard. <a href="#ref7" title="Jump back to footnote 7.">&#x2196;</a></sup><br />
        <sup id="fn8">8) Utilizes the standard <i>Find/Replace</i> dialog which does not directly map to Brief commands. This mostly accomodates the Brief command set without recreating the whole search and replace functionality.<a href="#ref8" title="Jump back to footnote 8.">&#x2196;</a></sup><br />
        <sup id="fn9">9) To set the search and translate parameters, first open the <i>Find/Replace</i> dialog, fill in the fields, and then either click an action or just close the dialog. The parameters will be saved.<a href="#ref9" title="Jump back to footnote 9.">&#x2196;</a></sup><br />
        <sup id="fn10">10) New command. Comes in handy when you want to extract some existing code from a complex statement and make it a new variable. First create the new variable then copy it. Then select the code statement and swap &lt;Alt+Ins&gt;. Then paste the code after the new variable. <a href="#ref10" title="Jump back to footnote 10.">&#x2196;</a></sup><br />
        <sup id="fn11">11) Not all commands are supported or work well. Actually accepts any &quot;non-printable&quot; key sequence, so not sure what works actually.<a href="#ref11" title="Jump back to footnote 11.">&#x2196;</a></sup><br />
        <sup id="fn12">12) Key binding taken from <i>Buffer List</i> command, which is not supported.<a href="#ref12" title="Jump back to footnote 12.">&#x2196;</a></sup><br />
        <sup id="fn13">13) Moves to far right side of window regardless of whether or not there is text there. May activate "Virtual Caret Mode" if in virtual space, i.e. no text.<a href="#ref13" title="Jump back to footnote 13.">&#x2196;</a></sup><br />
        <sup id="fn14">14) This is a deviation from documented functionality. I used the Visual Studio Code function instead of reworking it. <a href="#ref14" title="Jump back to footnote 14.">&#x2196;</a></sup><br />
        <sup id="fn15">15) This is a new command. I've always wanted to have a multi-item clipboard. <a href="#ref15" title="Jump back to footnote 15.">&#x2196;</a></sup><br />
        <sup id="fn16">16) This should be just &lt;CTL+X&gt;, but Visual Studio Code complains about trying to bind that key-sequence so I modified it a little. <a href="#ref16" title="Jump back to footnote 16.">&#x2196;</a></sup><br />
